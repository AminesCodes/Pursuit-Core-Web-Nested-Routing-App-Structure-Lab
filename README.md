Build a backend for a receipe API.  It should have the following functionality:

### Recipes

```js
{
    name: "Grilled Cheese",
    ingredients: [
        "Bread",
        "Cheese",
        "Butter"
    ]
    directions: "Preheat skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side-down onto skillet bottom and add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side-up on top of sandwich. Grill until lightly browned and flip over; continue grilling until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter and slice of cheese."
}
```
